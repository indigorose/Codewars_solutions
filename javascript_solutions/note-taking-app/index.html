			Many languages have words that carry meanings so specific or
			culturally rooted that they can't be neatly translated into English.
			One example is the Japanese word "tsundoku", which refers to the
			habit of acquiring books and letting them pile up unread, something
			many book lovers can relate to. Another is the Portuguese word
			"saudade", describing a deep, bittersweet longing for something or
			someone that is absent. Meanwhile, the French word "Dépaysement"
			captures the disorienting yet exciting feeling of being in a new
			place, far from home. These unique words remind us that language is
			more than vocabulary: it's a window into the values, habits, and
			emotions of the cultures that create it.
